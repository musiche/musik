		   I invite you to read this note about music effect on brain: <br>
		   Since 2006, two UCF professors — neuroscientist Kiminobu Sugaya and world-renowned violinist Ayako Yonetani — have been teaching one of the most popular courses in The Burnett Honors College. “Music and the Brain” explores how music impacts brain function and human behavior, including by reducing stress, pain and symptoms of depression as well as improving cognitive and motor skills, spatial-temporal learning and neurogenesis, which is the brain’s ability to produce neurons. Sugaya and Yonetani teach how people with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s also respond positively to music.“Usually in the late stages, Alzheimer’s patients are unresponsive,” Sugaya says. “But once you put in the headphones that play [their favorite] music, their eyes light up. They start moving and sometimes singing. The effect lasts maybe 10 minutes or so even after you turn off the music.”

			This can be seen on an MRI, where “lots of different parts of the brain light up,” he says. We sat down with the professors, who are also husband and wife, and asked them to explain which parts of the brain are activated by music.<br>
		    Turns out, whether it’s rock ‘n’ roll, jazz, hip-hop or classical, your gray matter prefers the same music you do. “It depends on your personal background,” Yonetani says. For a while, researchers believed that classical music increased brain activity and made its listeners smarter, a phenomenon called the Mozart effect. Not necessarily true, say Sugaya and Yonetani. In recent studies, they’ve found that people with dementia respond better to the music they grew up listening to. “If you play someone’s favorite music, different parts of the brain light up,” Sugaya explains. “That means memories associated with music are emotional memories, which never fade out — even in Alzheimer’s patients.</p></div>

			8 years ago after buying a trance & dance compilation CD, I decided I wanted to produce music and asked myself the same question.

			There was something magical about the way music was created, and being a musician already I thought it’d be an easy path to take.
	
			Like any normal person, I went to Google to find out how to get started and what I needed. Unfortunately, it didn’t go too well, I ended up downloading a weird program without any idea of what it was or how to use it.

			Confusion set in.

			I’ve decided to write this post for those wanting to become a music producer.

			You’ll learn about what a music producer does, things you should know about being a music producer, potential career paths, and most importantly – how to get started.</p>
			<h3 class="header">What does a music producer do?</h3>
			<p class="para">By the traditional definition, a music producer is someone who oversees, manages, and guides the process of producing and recording a song.

			But over the past 10-20 years, music production has become a lot more accessible. Quality music can be made on your standard laptop, and expensive hardware isn’t required.</p>
			<h3 class="header">Three things you should know about being a producer:</h3>
			<img src="https://wexfordmentalhealthassociation.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/music.gif">
			<p class="para">If you’re looking for an easy hobby, this isn’t it. But if you’re looking for something that will positively impact your life, cause you to think critically and artistically, and give you the joy of creating something – then it’s the hobby for you.

			Being a music producer is difficult for a number of reasons. The first one is that it takes a long time to get to a level where your music is actually worth releasing.
			There are intricacies involved in music production that not only take a while to understand in theory, but require deliberate practice.

			Even if you’ve got great musical ideas, your mixing skills might not be great, or your sound design may not be up to standard.

			Music production is also a very diverse field. A producer might produce music for a signer or rapper, write music for movies, design sounds for video games, record and engineer live bands, or simply produce music for themselves.  

			There are plenty of career opportunities as a producer, and it’s helpful to consider all the above.

			Most importantly though, and despite the difficulty, being a music producer is rewarding! There’s nothing more satisfying than finishing your own music and having people appreciate it. The rewards outweigh the frustration by far.</p></div>
